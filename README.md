# Instacart Grocery Orders - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores anonymised Instacart grocery shopping data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to uncover customer purchasing patterns, peak shopping times, and product demand insights ‚Äî similar to real-world tasks for Data Analyst or Reporting roles.

## üìä Project Highlights
- Data cleaning: checked for nulls, duplicates
- Exploratory analysis:
  - Orders by day of the week
  - Peak hours for placing orders
  - Time between customer purchases
- Dataset used: [Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/instacart/market-basket-analysis) (public Kaggle dataset)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Dataset Files

The original dataset files `orders.csv` and `order_products__prior.csv` have been excluded from this repository due to GitHub's file size limitations (100MB max).

If you'd like to run this project locally:

1. Download the Instacart dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data).
2. Place `orders.csv` and `order_products__prior.csv` in the root directory of this project.

The project will work as intended once the files are in place.

## SQL Integration

This project demonstrates SQL-based analysis of Instacart's grocery order dataset using SQLite and Python. Queries explore:
- Ordering patterns by day and hour
- Product demand trends
- Customer reorder behavior
- Average basket size

This mirrors business-critical reporting tasks common in data analyst roles.


## üõ† Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic data wrangling and visualisation

## ‚ö° About Me
I'm transitioning into data roles with a background in project supervision, administration, and charitable sectors. This project reflects my passion for practical data analysis and preparing for roles like Data Analyst or Reporting Analyst.
